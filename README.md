# STEELWORKS
## My magnum opus (its not hard to make something better, I just don't have the time.)
My previous disasterpiece has been updated to use a bad implementation of next.js. \
But thats not all. This bad implementation is garnished with a healthy dose of Rust based WebAssembly, and WebGL2. \
Now that I have got this up and running, it needs some content, so @ me with suggestions I guess, idk I'm new to hosting.


## TODO
* Add testing framework
* cleanse remaining bad node modules.
* Fix next.js implementation.
* Find Harold Holt.
* Add Latin Square games
* * Needs sub options for Towers or Sudoku or killer sudoku

### Latin Square game plan
1. Get latin Squares into a crate
- Start by gettin a guaranteed generation thats fast.
